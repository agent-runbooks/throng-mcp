# throng-mcp — development

For maintainers. Users start with [README.md](../README.md); the design and the exact tool contracts are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), the process (backlog, task cycle, roles) in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Running from the checkout

To run your working copy instead of the npm package: `pnpm install`, then `pnpm start` (`node src/mcp.ts`, Node >= 22.18 or 24, no build). Register it in place of the package:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user throng -- node /abs/path/to/throng-mcp/src/mcp.ts
```

## Development

- Gates: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`. The pre-commit hook (lefthook, installed by `pnpm install`) formats with prettier, runs `eslint --fix` and typecheck.
- Tests are vitest, next to the code (`src/**/*.test.ts`). They drive `test/fake-agent` (an ACP agent with scripted scenarios) and never call an LLM; real harnesses only in `scripts/smoke/`, run by hand. `src/skill.test.ts` keeps `skills/throng/SKILL.md` to the existing tool names and error codes.

## Build and package

- `pnpm build` (tsdown, config in `tsdown.config.ts`) writes `dist/mcp.js`, the bin, and `dist/structured/submit-tool.js`, spawned for `schema` runs; shared code may land in a chunk under `dist/`. The runtime libraries are `devDependencies`, bundled into `dist/`: the package has no dependencies of its own. The build also writes `dist/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, the licenses of the bundled packages, collected from the modules that ended up in the bundle (`scripts/build/third-party-licenses.ts`); a bundled package with neither a license file nor a `license` field fails the build. `ci:build` is the same for CI; `prepack` runs it, so `pnpm pack` and `pnpm publish` always ship a fresh build. `dist/` is ignored by git, prettier and eslint.
- Why a build: Node refuses to strip types under `node_modules`, so the package can't ship `src/`. Development, tests and smoke keep running the sources (`node src/mcp.ts`, Node >= 22.18 or 24); the published package needs Node `^22.13 || >=24`.
- The version from `package.json` and `data/registry.json` are JSON imports, inlined at build time: a registry update needs a rebuild, and `data/` is not in the package.
- `src/mcp.ts` resolves the submit tool's path from its own location (`.ts` next to the sources, `.js` in `dist/`) and passes it down as `RunContext.submitTool`.
- The tarball holds `dist/`, `skills/`, `docs/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `package.json`. `pnpm pack --dry-run` lists it; `scripts/pack.test.ts` (in `pnpm test`) packs it into a temp dir, checks that list, that the packed `package.json` has no `dependencies` or `peerDependencies`, that `dist/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` names `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` and that `dist/` stays under 2 MB, and runs `node dist/mcp.js` from the unpacked package, with no `node_modules` anywhere, against the fake agent: `list_harnesses` and a `run_thronglet` with a `schema`.

## Release

- A task commit touching `src/` (tests aside), `data/` or the published fields of `package.json` carries a changeset, `pnpm changeset`; the rule and the bump levels are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#task-cycle). Config: `.changeset/config.json`.
- `ci:changesets` (`changeset status --since=origin/main`) runs in CI on every push and PR. It fails any change to `src/` (tests aside), `data/` or `package.json` that has no changeset. It matches `package.json` as a whole file, so a PR that only touches `devDependencies` or `scripts` needs `pnpm changeset --empty`. On main it compares main with itself and always passes.
- Dependency bumps come from dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly, one grouped PR, a 7-day cooldown, the same as `minimumReleaseAge` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for local installs. The Changesets CI check is skipped for dependabot's own pushes. A bump of a bundled library (the five runtime libraries in [DESIGN §9](DESIGN.md#9-package-language-tests)) ships to users, so before merging add a patch changeset to the PR (`pnpm changeset` on the branch, text "Update <lib> to <version>"); that commit runs the check again. A bump of dev tooling alone needs none and is merged as is.
- On push to main the Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, `changesets/action`) opens or updates the "Upcoming Release" PR: `changeset version` bumps `package.json` and writes `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Merging that PR runs `pnpm run ci:publish` (`ci:build` + `changeset publish`) with npm trusted publishing (OIDC, no token in the repo), and creates the GitHub release and the tag `throng-mcp@x.y.z`.
- The first publish goes by hand from a clean checkout, `pnpm publish --access public`: npmjs.com configures a trusted publisher only on a package that already exists (THRONG-18). Until `throng-mcp@0.1.0` is on npm, every Release run on main fails at `changeset publish` and publishes or tags nothing. So publish by hand right after the release setup lands on main, or before pushing it.

## Files on disk

- `~/.cache/throng/sessions/<session_id>.json`: one record per session (`harness, model, effort, cwd, description, created_at, last_used_at`), read by `send_message`, `wait_thronglet` and `list_thronglets`. Every turn also writes `turn_started_at` and `turn_pid` (the server process running it) while it runs, then replaces them with `last_result` (the success payload) or `last_error` (the failure payload) and updates `last_used_at`. At start the server gives every record whose `turn_pid` is gone the interrupted `last_error`.
- Records are rotated at server start: files older than 14 days are deleted.
- Server logs are short lines on stderr (start/stop, permission decisions, each run's outcome, errors); the MCP client decides where they end up.
- throng keeps no transcripts: the harness logs every session itself, find it by `session_id`.
- `data/registry.json` in the repo is a verbatim snapshot of the ACP registry, https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json, taken 2026-09-27, inlined into the bundle at build time. It supplies the adapters' launch `args`/`env` and the install hints ([DESIGN §2.3](DESIGN.md#23-adapters), [§4.1](DESIGN.md#41-harnesses-and-discovery)).

## Smoke

Runs one real task against a real harness with your env, config and cache. Spends tokens; one harness at a time.

```bash
pnpm smoke:claude          # claude/sonnet
pnpm smoke:claude-schema   # claude/sonnet with --schema (structured output)
pnpm smoke:codex           # codex/gpt-6-luna
pnpm smoke:codex-schema    # codex/gpt-6-luna with --schema
pnpm smoke:opencode        # opencode/openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3-flash (needs openrouter configured in opencode)
pnpm smoke:opencode-schema # opencode/openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3-flash with --schema
pnpm smoke:gemini          # gemini/auto (follow-up skipped: gemini has no session/resume)
pnpm smoke:gemini-schema   # gemini/auto with --schema
pnpm smoke:cursor          # cursor/default (Auto, works on a free plan; the follow-up goes through session/load)
pnpm smoke:cursor-schema   # cursor/default with --schema
pnpm smoke opencode/<provider>/<model>                  # custom provider
pnpm smoke:claude -- --prompt "…" --cwd /some/dir --timeout 600
pnpm smoke:claude -- --no-follow-up                    # skip the send_message step
pnpm smoke:claude -- --schema                          # run_thronglet with a schema {file, content}
pnpm smoke:claude -- --background                      # both turns with background: true, results via wait_thronglet
pnpm smoke:claude -- --cancel                          # background run, list_thronglets, cancel_thronglet, wait_thronglet
pnpm smoke:claude -- --steer                           # background run kept busy by `sleep 60`, a 10 s wait (--steer-delay <s>), then send_message steer
```

The script starts the server, prints the `list_harnesses` table (versions, model counts, efforts, commands, unavailable reasons, limits), runs `run_thronglet` in a fresh temp dir asking the agent to write `pong.txt`, prints the payload, then checks:

- `PASS: pong.txt written` / `FAIL: …`: the file exists with content `pong`. The check runs with a custom `--prompt` too, so such a prompt should also write `pong.txt`. A `--cwd` that already contains `pong.txt` is refused (exit 2).
- `PASS: structured is {file: pong.txt, content: pong}` / `FAIL: structured is …`: with `--schema` only; the run asks for the created file's name and content as structured output, and the payload's `structured` must match.
- `PASS: send_message answered pong.txt` / `FAIL: send_message …`: a `send_message` into the same session asks which file it created; its payload is printed and the answer must mention `pong.txt`. Skipped when the run failed, with `--no-follow-up` (e.g. with a custom `--prompt`), and for gemini, which can't resume a session (`follow-up step skipped: gemini has no session/resume, so no send_message`). `--steer` with gemini is a usage error.
- `PASS: run_thronglet background accepted` / `PASS: send_message background accepted`: with `--background` only; the call answered `{session_id, state, queued}` (printed as `pending:`), and `wait_thronglet` then delivers the payload the checks above run on.
- With `--cancel` instead of the pong.txt and follow-up checks: `PASS: run_thronglet background accepted`, `PASS: list_thronglets shows the turn running` (the row has description `smoke: ping/pong`), `PASS: cancel_thronglet cancelled the turn` (`cancelled_turn: true`), `PASS: wait_thronglet returned cancelled`, `PASS: list_thronglets shows the turn failed with cancelled`.
- With `--steer` instead of the pong.txt and follow-up checks: `PASS: run_thronglet background accepted` (the prompt asks for `sleep 60` as one tool call, so there is a turn to interrupt), then a 10 s wait (`--steer-delay <s>` changes it) so the steer lands while the turn is busy (no tool shows a background turn's activity, and Cursor has no session to load until the turn has produced output), `PASS: send_message steer answered STEERED` (a synchronous `send_message` with `steer: true` asks for a line starting with STEERED and what the agent was doing; the payload is printed), `PASS: list_thronglets shows the session idle`.
- `PASS: no orphans` / `FAIL: orphaned adapter processes: <pids>`: no new `claude-agent-acp`, `codex-acp`, `opencode acp`, `gemini.*--acp` (regex), `cursor-agent` or `submit-tool` process is alive 12 s after the client closed (throng's shutdown of an adapter: 5 s before SIGTERM, 5 s more before SIGKILL, plus 2 s). `FAIL: cannot check orphans (…)` when `pgrep` is missing or fails.

Exit code: 0 all passed; 1 a FAIL or a tool error; 2 bad usage, harness unavailable or unknown model (the valid models are printed). Server stderr is prefixed `[server]`, progress `[progress]`. The temp dir is removed on success and kept (path printed) on failure.

The smoke takes the permission policy from the throng config like the server does, so another policy is another config file through `THRONG_MCP_CONFIG`. The three Gemini CLI runs (after `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` and signing in with `gemini`):

```bash
# 1. auto (mode yolo) edits a file: PASS: pong.txt written, the follow-up skipped
printf 'permissions: auto\n' > /tmp/throng-auto.yaml
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-auto.yaml pnpm smoke:gemini

# 2. deny_all (mode default) refuses the edit: the run succeeds, FAIL: pong.txt not found, exit 1 — the expected outcome
printf 'permissions: deny_all\n' > /tmp/throng-deny.yaml
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-deny.yaml pnpm smoke:gemini

# 3. model and effort: the run uses the model `auto`, warnings has `effort "high" ignored: gemini exposes no effort option`
pnpm smoke gemini/auto:high
```

Runs 1 and 2 replace your own config for that run, so a `permissions` line of yours can't change the mode; if it sets anything else you need (e.g. `harnesses.gemini.command`), copy it into the file.

The Cursor CLI runs (after `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash` and `agent login`; `list_harnesses` must show cursor with its models, not a `handshake_failed` asking for `agent login`), with the config files above:

```bash
# 1. auto (cursor-agent acp --force): PASS: pong.txt written, PASS: send_message answered pong.txt (session/load)
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-auto.yaml pnpm smoke:cursor

# 2. ask + deny, a file edit: Cursor never asks about edits, so PASS: pong.txt written is the expected outcome here
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-deny.yaml pnpm smoke:cursor

# 3. ask + deny, a shell command: Cursor asks, throng answers reject-once; the run succeeds,
#    FAIL: pong.txt not found, exit 1 — the expected outcome; the server log has `permission … choice=reject-once`
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-deny.yaml pnpm smoke:cursor -- --no-follow-up \
  --prompt "Run exactly this shell command and nothing else: echo pong > pong.txt. Do not edit files any other way. Then reply done."

# 3b. the same shell command under auto: --force runs it without request_permission; PASS: pong.txt written,
#     no `permission` line in the server log
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-auto.yaml pnpm smoke:cursor -- --no-follow-up \
  --prompt "Run exactly this shell command and nothing else: echo pong > pong.txt. Do not edit files any other way. Then reply done."

# 4. steer through session/load: PASS: send_message steer answered STEERED
THRONG_MCP_CONFIG=/tmp/throng-auto.yaml pnpm smoke:cursor -- --steer

# 5. effort: the run uses Auto, warnings has `effort "high" ignored: cursor exposes no effort option`
pnpm smoke cursor/default:high

# 6. a model by its name before the bracket: no model_rejected, the run uses the listed `gpt-5.4-nano[…]` value; on a free
#    plan the text is "Upgrade your plan to continue" and FAIL: pong.txt not found is expected
pnpm smoke cursor/gpt-5.4-nano --no-follow-up
```

Manual items that need an interactive Claude Code session:

1. Esc during a running `run_thronglet`; afterwards `pgrep -f "claude-agent-acp|codex-acp|opencode acp|gemini.*--acp|cursor-agent"` prints nothing.
2. A call over 2 min goes to the background: e.g. prompt `run sleep 150 in the shell, then reply done`; the result arrives as a notification.
3. OpenCode with a custom provider from `opencode.json`.

Record the adapter versions `list_harnesses` reported in the backlog task notes.
